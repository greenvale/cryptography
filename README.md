# Cryptology

This repository contains my implementations of cryptology-related algorithms and useful functions.

## Hashing functions

Hashing functions are one-way encryption algorithms that process an arbitrary-length input to give a fixed-length "message digest". Hashing functions should exhibit certain properties:
* The probability that modifying the input will change the output is very high
* Non-reversibility
* Uniformity, i.e. minimal collisions

The hashing functions implemented thus far are:
* SHA-1

## Symmetric encryption functions

Symmetric encryption functions take a message and private key as inputs to produce an encrypted message. The same private key is then used to decrypt the message.

The symmetric encryption functions implemented thus far are:
* ...
